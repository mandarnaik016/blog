In this post, We will do malware analysis and reverse engineering on a sample called **PXRECVOWEIWOEI** (AKA PureLogs Stealer).

The source of the sample is

~~~
hxxps[://]bazaar[.]abuse[.]ch/sample/574403dce45be3a5edec18e66f16fef5e013ce99c7713479ab67c11e6f472330/#intel
~~~

### Static Analysis

Let's get the hash of the file first.

~~~
SHA256: 574403DCE45BE3A5EDEC18E66F16FEF5E013CE99C7713479AB67C11E6F472330
~~~

On [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/574403dce45be3a5edec18e66f16fef5e013ce99c7713479ab67c11e6f472330/detection), the file is detected as malicious by 25 engines.

The sample opened in notepad++ looks full of long strings assigned to variables with extremely long names.

{% include lazyimg.html img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/sample-notepadpp.png" img_alt="Sample Notepad++" %}

The variables seem to be added purposely to distract us from the actual investigation point. The occurrence of variables is only one for each, meaning they are declared with strings but never used.

{% include lazyimg.html img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/variables-never-used.png" img_alt="Variables Never Used" %}

After ignoring them, we see some interesting variables that have been used repeatedly. 

{% include lazyimg.html img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/interesting-variables.png" img_alt="Interesting Variables" %}

Let's evaluate the variables.

{% include lazyimg.html img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/tonta.png" img_alt="Variable: tonta" %}

{% include lazyimg.html img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/aligulado.png" img_alt="Variable: aligulado" %}

{% include lazyimg.html img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/publicista.png" img_alt="Variable: publicista" %}

The variables are interconnected. i.e. the variable *tonta* is used in variable *aligulado*, inturn that variable is used in *publicista*.
We are going to focus on the content of *publicista*. We can see a base64 string, after decoding it.

{% include lazyimg.html img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/obfuscated-powershell.png" img_alt="Obfuscated Powershell" %}

The decoded base64 is a powershell script that is gibberish. Let's evaluate the script to make it understandable.

{% include lazyimg.html img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/powershell-writehost.png" img_alt="Powershell Writehost" %}

After beautifying the script, we can connect the dots

{% include lazyimg.html img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/powershell-readable.png" img_alt="Powershell Readable" %}

The powershell script downloads the *DetahNoteJ.txt*, loads the content into a variable, then base64 decodes that content, eventually storing it in a variable called *$assembly*. The result of the above script can be accessed via variable *$OWjuxD* (I.e. base64 decode of *$Codigo*).

Finally, the output is executed via a powershell.

Let's check the content of a file called *DetahNoteJ.txt*. (PSSS: Shouldn't the filename be DeathNote and not DetahNoteJ?)

{% include lazyimg.html img_src="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/lowly/detahnotej.png" img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/detahnotej.png" img_alt="DetahNoteJ" %}

After base64 decoding and checking the file type

{% include lazyimg.html img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/detahnotej-filetype.png" img_alt="DetahNoteJ Filetype" %}

Now we can check the compiler or packer used to compile or protect the program; we can use *DIE* for this.

{% include lazyimg.html img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/die.png" img_alt="DIE" %}

### Dynamic Analysis

The sample is compiled in .NET without any packer or crypter used. we can directly decompile it using *dnSpy*

{% include lazyimg.html img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/dnspy.png" img_alt="dnSpy" %}

After a night with tea by my side, I was not able to understand the logic behind few variables, and was not able to decrypt them either. Let's directly execute the sample.

{% include lazyimg.html img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/procmon.png" img_alt="ProcMon" %}

{% include lazyimg.html img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/regshot.png" img_alt="Regshot" %}

{% include lazyimg.html img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/inetsim.png" img_alt="INetSim" %}

My platform architecture seems incompatible, the program exited with some errors. 

Atlast, we get no intel from dynamic analysis.

On VirusTotal, the file *DetahNoteJ.txt* is detected by 17 engines.

~~~
SHA256: 16912B71BDEFBB0B9E0B0E71D85B0095880D4DC250239E7D26E12454F7F6BADF
~~~

{% include lazyimg.html img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/detahnotej-vt.png" img_alt="DetahNoteJ VT" %}

Whereas the base64 decoded content of *DetahNoteJ.txt* is a DLL file, detected by 7 engines.

~~~
SHA256: 97164081607B6FDB9B095CB01BB0A818FC77DB92DAD38B910B05A90160748756
~~~

{% include lazyimg.html img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/purelog/detahnotej-decoded-vt.png" img_alt="DetahNoteJ Decoded VT" %}

We meet next time dissecting another sample or comming up with an evasion technique until then **čau čau**
