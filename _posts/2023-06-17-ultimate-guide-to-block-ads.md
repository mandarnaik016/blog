## Why Ad-blockers?

Have at look at below image (p.s: The numbers could have been more than you can ever imagine!).

I am used to change my OS and browsers as the result the numbers of ads blocked is quite less.

I agree with you that some of the sites on the internet survive on the money earned through ads but now a days most of the time ads are present to **track us** down.

## How Ad-blockers Work?

They exactly work like depicted below

Nothing rocket science over here they contains the rules to block and filter the webpage you are viewing. 

## How to Block Ads?
  

- To block ads at **host level**, I use Dan Pollock [filter list](http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/).
	1. Copy the host entries from the website.
	2. Paste the entries in the host file located at 
		- For Windows 9x and ME place this file at "C:\Windows\hosts"
		- For NT, Win2K and XP use "C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts" or "C:\winnt\system32\drivers\etc\hosts"
		- For Windows 7 and Vista use "C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts" or "%systemroot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts"
		- For Windows 8 and Windows 10 use "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts"
	3. Final host file should look similar to below one (Make sure to use notepad in administration mode).

- To block ads at **OS level**, I use [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/).
	1. Create a account and configure the filter list in the block tab.
	2. Then Download their installer.
	3. After installing, right-click on NextDNS icon in the Systray then open the Settings. Set your Configuration ID.
	4. Right-click on NextDNS icon in the Systray, then click on Enable.

- To block ads at **browser level**, I use [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/).
	1. Add the extension to your browser.
	2. Enable all the filter list present in uBlock Origin.
