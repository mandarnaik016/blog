From the first part of malware analysis of VIP keylogger, we ended up with two executables.

We will call them *orange_part1.exe.vir* that has an actual name being *tzeyswvngw.tmp* and *orange_part2.exe.vir* that has an actual name being *aaotaboryx.tmp*

Let's continue with the analysis,

The file *orange_part1.exe.vir* has an SHA256 hash of,
```0cae791ae86fd4960e6f9d62aac7941b1eee669e8ae373b28b32fba45e4bf46e```

The file is present on Virustotal and is being detected by 8 AV.

We can use dnSpy to view the decompiled source code.
