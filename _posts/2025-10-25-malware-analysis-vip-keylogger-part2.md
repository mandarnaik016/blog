Hello, Let's continue with the analysis of VIP keylogger.

From the first part of malware analysis, we ended up with two executables.

We will call them *orange_part1.exe.vir* that has an actual name being *tzeyswvngw.tmp* and *orange_part2.exe.vir* that has an actual name being *aaotaboryx.tmp*

The file *orange_part1.exe.vir* has an SHA256 hash of,
```
0cae791ae86fd4960e6f9d62aac7941b1eee669e8ae373b28b32fba45e4bf46e
```

The file is present on Virustotal and is being detected by 8 AV.

The file is written in the .NET language, as shown by DIE.
{% include lazyimg.html img_src="../assets/img/analysis/vipkeylogger2/lowly/die-of-orange_part1.exe.vir.jpeg" img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/vipkeylogger2/die-of-orange_part1.exe.vir.png" img_caption="Figure 2: DIE of orange_part1.exe.vir" img_alt="DIE of orange_part1.exe.vir" %}

We can use dnSpy to view the decompiled source code.
{% include lazyimg.html img_src="../assets/img/analysis/vipkeylogger2/lowly/decompiled-source-code-of-orange_part1.exe.vir.jpeg" img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/vipkeylogger2/decompiled-source-code-of-orange_part1.exe.vir.png" img_caption="Figure 3: Decompiled source code of orange_part1.exe.vir" img_alt="Decompiled source code of orange_part1.exe.vir" %}

The main function is empty. We assume this is a dummy file that does nothing when executed.

Let's start with the analysis of the second file,

The second file *orange_part2.exe.vir* has an SHA256 hash of,
```
ca9e6eb1c8f2be20eaf9c220cf8482c264edd9c42389fc391eeed41dfe8de59b
```

The file is present on Virustotal and is being detected by 50 AV.
{% include lazyimg.html img_src="../assets/img/analysis/vipkeylogger2/lowly/virustotal-result-of-aaotaboryx.tmp.jpeg" img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/vipkeylogger2/virustotal-result-of-aaotaboryx.tmp.png" img_caption="Figure 4: Virustotal result of aaotaboryx.tmp" img_alt="Virustotal result of aaotaboryx.tmp" %}

This file is also written in the .NET language, as shown by DIE
{% include lazyimg.html img_src="../assets/img/analysis/vipkeylogger2/lowly/die-of-orange_part2.exe.vir.jpeg" img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/vipkeylogger2/die-of-orange_part2.exe.vir.png" img_caption="Figure 5: DIE of orange_part2.exe.vir" img_alt="DIE of orange_part2.exe.vir" %}

The file *orange_part2.exe.vir* contains suspicious functions like VirtualProtect, CreateDecryptor, etc.
{% include lazyimg.html img_src="../assets/img/analysis/vipkeylogger2/lowly/suspicious-flags.jpeg" img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/vipkeylogger2/suspicious-flags.png" img_caption="Figure 6: Suspicious flags" img_alt="Suspicious flags" %}

The strings within do provide insightful data,
{% include lazyimg.html img_src="../assets/img/analysis/vipkeylogger2/lowly/strings-within-orange_part2.exe.vir.jpeg" img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/vipkeylogger2/strings-within-orange_part2.exe.vir.png" img_caption="Figure 7: Strings within orange_part2.exe.vir" img_alt="Strings within orange_part2.exe.vir" %}

Strings insight (From fig. 7):
1. Checks some values and extensions for condition matching.
2. Base64 encoded strings for data obfuscation.
3. Sets exclusions for itself in Microsoft Defender to evade detection.

To identify further capabilities, we use Capa,
{% include lazyimg.html img_src="../assets/img/analysis/vipkeylogger2/lowly/capabilities-of-orange_part2.exe.vir.jpeg" img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/vipkeylogger2/capabilities-of-orange_part2.exe.vir.png" img_caption="Figure 8: Capabilities of orange_part2.exe.vir" img_alt="Capabilities of orange_part2.exe.vir" %}

We load the sample in dnSpy and locate the main function to understand the behavior and execution flow.
{% include lazyimg.html img_src="../assets/img/analysis/vipkeylogger2/lowly/initial-code-of-orange_part2.exe.vir.jpeg" img_datasrc="../assets/img/analysis/vipkeylogger2/initial-code-of-orange_part2.exe.vir.png" img_caption="Figure 9: Initial code of orange_part2.exe.vir" img_alt="Initial code of orange_part2.exe.vir" %}

Code Insight (From fig. 9):
1. The application executes with a hidden window. This is one of the capabilities we identified using Capa, being listed as "hide graphical window".
2. The "ntdll.dll" is loaded, and the "EtwEventWrite" function is used to turn off telemetry. It would be categorized as "patch Event Tracing for Windows function".
3. From fig. 6, VirtualProtect is being used to make the memory location read-write.
4. At last, the string text is being initialized.
